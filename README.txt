I have started my initial commit on mikes website of 2 pages concluding 4 pages in total

Auditing initially before starting to edit code.

2 page website with both desktop and mobile versions.

Needs SEO, Performance Boost, Accessibility, and Best Practices.

Using lighthouse and comparing to update audit report.



I took away the background images to reduce the load time to open the pages more efficiently as well as converted the formats from jpg to Webp. 
I adjusted the color of the buttons to be more contrasted to be more visible. 
I changed the images to text placed "Quotes" and then bolded the text necessary. 
I put proper widths and heights on the converted images and put the suggested widths and heights at 325 for mobile and 270 for desktop. 
I minified js/css and extensions to increase performance.
I changed the page2 to Contact to create less confusion.
Also removed the hacky keywords that don't correlate with the image and design of the website.
Corrected the form error. I put the script tags on the bottom of the page to help load times. validated html and css
